# callr

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/traitecoevo/callr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/traitecoevo/callr)

The `callr` package has two main uses; calling R from other programs (including the shell) and for calling other programs from R.

## Calling R from the shell

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
suppressMessages(devtools::load_all())
file.copy(system.file(c("example.json", "example.R"), package="callr"), ".", overwrite=TRUE)
lang_output <- function(x, lang) {
  cat(c(sprintf("```%s", lang), x, "```"), sep="\n")
}
json_output <- function(x) lang_output(x, "json")
r_output <- function(x) lang_output(x, "r")
plain_output <- function(x) lang_output(x, "plain")
```

There are myriad interfaces for calling R from other languages (e.g., the python package `rpy2`) but debugging these interfaces when something goes wrong is challenging.  Similarly, ad-hoc decisions about serialisation must be made that can fail subtly.  We use the [`jsonlite`](https://github.com/jeroenooms/jsonlite) package to serialise calls to R from any language to give a simple and consistent interface.

`callr` lets you specify, in a json file,

* packages to load
* R files to source
* A function to call
* Arguments to the function

The result will then be added back into the original file.  For example, suppose you had some R function definitions (in a file `example.R`)

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
r_output(readLines("example.R"))
```

We might write a json file:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
json_output(readLines("example.json"))
```

This will be translated into a function:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
r_output(deparse(json_call(filename="example.json")))
```

Note that because json hashes do not guarantee order, the arguments are in an array (the `[` bits), and the argument name goes in the `name` field.  Names are optional.

This can be run from within R like:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
callr("example.json")
```

Though it will certainly be easier to run from the a shell session with:

```
Rscript -e 'callr::callr("example.json")
```

or by installing the shell script helper:

```r
callr::install_callr("~/bin")
```

And running

```
callr example.json
```

Regardless of how `callr` is run, the file `example.json` now includes output:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
json_output(readLines("example.json"))
```

Further options to the script:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
plain_output(callr::call_system("callr", "--help"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
file.remove("example.R", "example.json")
```

## Calling system programs from R

Calling system commands from R error prone as error handling is difficult and varies on things like whether standard output is to be collected.  `callr` includes a function `call_system` for the case where a system call is blocking (i.e., we want to wait until it completes).  It is a very thin wrapper around R's `system2` function and hides output unless there is an error, when it will print a (possibly truncated) error message.  This makes it useful for things like output of a LaTeX compilation where the amount of generated output is far too much to be useful but when an error occurs, some output is useful.

All output (non-truncated) will be returned, invisibly, by a successful run of `call_system`.

As an example, due to the travis badge in this README, LaTeX cannot compile the LaTeX that pandoc generates:

```{r}
callr::call_system("pandoc", c("README.md", "-o", "README.tex", "--standalone"))
callr::call_system("pdflatex",
                   c("-interaction=nonstopmode", "-halt-on-error",
                     "README.tex"))
```

only the last bit of output is included in the error, with many lines of output dropped.

```{r, results="hide", echo=FALSE}
file.remove("README.aux", "README.log", "README.out", "README.tex")
```

## Installation

Install from github with

```
devtools::install_github("traitecoevo/callr")
callr::install_callr("~/bin")
```

replacing the path in the second line with something in your `$PATH`.
